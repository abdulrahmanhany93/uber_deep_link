# Flutter Uber Ride Request App

The main idea of the app is to extract a Google Maps location link 🌍 and seamlessly initiate an Uber ride 🚗 to that location using Uber's deep link URL scheme. This project demonstrates my proficiency in mobile app development, state management, and integrating complex features seamlessly. Here are some of the key highlights:

✅ **Regular Expressions:** Utilizing regex to extract specific data from URLs 🔍, such as place names and coordinates.

✅ **Dependency Injection:** Leveraging the service locator pattern 🧩 for clean and maintainable code with easy dependency management.

✅ **Use Case Pattern:** Structuring business logic into use cases 🛠️ for improved organization and testability.

✅ **Repository Pattern:** Abstracting data layer operations 📚 to create a modular and scalable codebase.

✅ **Custom Widgets:** Designing reusable UI components 🎨, such as navigation buttons and location input fields, to enhance user interaction.

✅ **Deep Linking:** Implementing dynamic and flexible routing based on URLs 🔗 to provide a seamless navigation experience.

✅ **Uber Deep Link URL Scheme:** Utilizing Uber's deep link URL scheme 🚗 to initiate rides directly from the app.

✅ **Error Handling:** Establishing a structured approach to manage and respond to errors ⚠️ effectively.
